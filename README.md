This Project was develped by dobob. For Highschool club project. Programmed By dobob.

Require Arduino (If you use pro mini you need prepare the 3.3Voltage Regulater )
WS2812 LED Moudle (1)

RC522 RFID Moudle (1)

Relay Moudle (1)

Wireling
Accoding to my source code You need wireing

====RFID Moulde====

SDA = 10

SCK = 13

MOSI = 11

MISO = 12

IRQ = No wireing

GND = GND

RST = 9

3.3 = 3.3 (if you use Pro mini you need the 3.3V Regulater)

====NeoPixel====

5V = 5V

DIN = 5

GND = GND

====Relay====

5V = 5V

DIN = 3

GND = GND
