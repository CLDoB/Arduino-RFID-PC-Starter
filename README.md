### INCLUDING PCB!!

This Project was develped by dobob. For Highschool club project. Programmed By dobob.

Require Arduino (If you use pro mini you need prepare the 3.3Voltage Regulater )
WS2812 LED Module (1)

RC522 RFID Module (1)

Relay Module (1)

Wireling
Accoding to my source code You need wireing

# RFID Module

SDA = 10

SCK = 13

MOSI = 11

MISO = 12

IRQ = No wireing

GND = GND

RST = 9

3.3 = 3.3 (if you use Pro mini you need the 3.3V Regulater)

# NeoPixel

5V = 5V

DIN = 5

GND = GND

# Relay

5V = 5V

DIN = 3

GND = GND

# Compile

You need this Arduino Library
